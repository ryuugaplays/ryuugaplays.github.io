I"√ <p><strong>Welcome to my blogsite</strong> this will be a step by step guide on how to approach learning languages (specifically Japanese). The general mindset you want to adopt is ‚ÄòComprehensive and Compelling Input‚Äô.</p>

<p>The only way to learn languages effectively is through <ins>lots and lots and LOTS of Input</ins>. What kind of input? You want to be looking for input that are just slightly above your current level, for example, a sentence that has 80% of known words and about 20% of unknown words is the best ratio. This is known as <ins><em>Comprehensive Input</em></ins>.</p>

<p>Next you want to be inputting materials that interests you and relates to you on a personal level. If you like sports, then you will resonate better with sports terms, etc. This is known as <ins><em>Compelling Input.</em></ins> In any case, Inputting/ Immersion will ALWAYS take priority over textbook/anki. If you had limited amount of time and had to choose between the two, always choose Input. Okay? Let‚Äôs get started!</p>

<p><b>Step 0</b><br />
	- Learn Hiragana + Katakana (free app) (can be learned in two weeks)<br />
Some recommendations:<br />
	-  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mardukcorp.kawaiinihongo">Kawaii Nihongo</a> - play minigames while learning<br />
	- <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.jfkc.HiraganaMemoryHintApp.En">Hiragana Memory</a> - use mnemonics<br />
	- <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pha.viz.a0001.alephbet&amp;hl=en_US">Read and Write</a> - Comprehensive textbook-like lesson+writing/tracing<br />
Everyone learns differently here, pick whatever works for you. Personally I recommend learning through Visual (mnemonic) and Audio.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b><br />
	 - Get <a href="https://amzn.to/3hB1Svo">Tae Kim</a> and learn basic grammar structure<br />
	 - Start reading manga that has 85% hiragana (usually manga made for kids like Dragonball etc.)<br />
	 - Start watching anime and other content with <em><ins>Japanese+romaji subtitles</ins></em> (re-watching anime you‚Äôve seen is great practice)</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b><br />
	- After a few weeks of the above, try to recognize a few simple Kanji<br />
	- Once you have about 20 basic kanji you can start <a href="https://amzn.to/3h1Dent">RTK</a><br />
	- Read RTK while doing <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/1svvsr7f9cnpwka/Recognition_RTK.apkg/file">RRTK</a> (<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">anki</a> deck)<br /></p>
<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> You don't have to finish RTK! It is only used to train your brain to recognize kanji. Before RTK, all kanji looks like a blob of lines. After about 1000 RTK words you should be able to easily distinguish between the different radicals etc. (not a blob anymore)<br />
	Once your brain has trained its recognition muscles, you don't need RTK anymore.</blockquote>

<p><b>Step 3</b><br />
	- Read more advanced material that has more kanji (light novels, short VN etc.)<br />
	- Continue watching anime with Japanese subtitles, but also try to start watching Japanese Youtube(real people content)</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b><br />
	- Mine the sentences you don‚Äôt know into <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>. Sentences give you context. Context is king.<br />
	- Do Anki Reps everyday. Once you‚Äôre done with daily reps, go back to step 3, rinse repeat.</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b><br />
	- Once you hit about 10K sentences, introduce shadowing(imitating speech) into your routine. Imitating native speech (especially ‚Äúreal people content‚Äù) is crucial to speaking.<br />
	- Repeat Steps 3-4-5 until mastery</p>

<blockquote><strong>NOTE:</strong> Don't make up your own sentences!! Every language has their own native expressions, If you're translating from your native language OR if you're trying to make up sentences based on grammar rules, you will only sound weird/unnatural. Keep shadowing, the sentences will come naturally. Shadow content that you want to talk about, example: If you want to talk about games, then shadow a Gaming Review Youtube channel, they will contain all the native expressions used to explain games etc. Mine those sentences!</blockquote>

<p><b>Conclusion</b><br />
I will reiterate here because it is worth repeating, <ins>Input. Input. Input. Always Input.</ins> At the early stages, Be careful not to fall into one or more of these Traps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I need to memorize ALL the vocabulary through pre-made decks</li>
	<li>I need to understand ALL the grammar structures before consuming native material</li>
	<li>I need to understand every single word I am consuming</li>
	<li>I need to practice speaking to be good</li>
</ul>

<p>These traps are what keeps a beginner from graduating into intermediate and advanced. So if you‚Äôre feeling stuck as a beginner and feeling bored of doing textbook exercises, you gotta make that jump into Inputting/ Immersing. I won‚Äôt lie to you, when you start immersing you won‚Äôt understand much of anything, and then your brain will tell you ‚Äòmaybe you should‚Äôve done more vocab cards etc‚Äô but ignore this feeling, follow the 80:20 ratio, and keep Inputting material that you LOVE.<br />
You WILL break that barrier and transcend into the next level.</p>

<h1>FAQS</h1>
<p><b>I don‚Äôt like Anki, I can‚Äôt remember anything!</b><br />
Yes.</p>

<p><b>So then what should I do?</b><br />
Do Anki. If you‚Äôre finding it difficult to remember then the words are too difficult for you RIGHT NOW, in which case you should delete those words. Fastest way to learn is to find topics that ‚Äòclick‚Äô with you on a personal level. Topics that interests you will have vocabulary that you can relate to very quickly and easily.<br /></p>

<p>For example if you‚Äôre not a phytologist and have absolutely no interest in botany, you‚Äôll probably find it very hard to learn words like <em>‚ÄòPrunus serrulata‚Äô</em> and <em>‚ÄòAcer pseudoplatanus‚Äô</em>. Conversely if you like computers and games, it will be easy to learn <em>‚ÄòAnti-aliasing‚Äô</em> and <em>‚Äòrendering‚Äô</em>. The words themselves are not inherently difficult, difficulty only pertains to how closely it relates to you personally.</p>

<p><b>But if I delete words, aren‚Äôt I missing out on vocabulary?</b><br />
It doesn‚Äôt matter, if the word doesn‚Äôt relate to you, its probably not important to you right NOW. When the time is right, it will present itself to you again, hopefully by that time, you would have learned the surrounding words in that sentence to make sense of the previously unknown word.<br /></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúLike a 10000 piece Jigsaw puzzle, when you pick up the First piece and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, you put it down. You look for the pieces that makes the most sense, one after another, eventually the puzzle gets filled and you will pick up that First piece once again. But this time because the puzzle is mostly filled, you can see where this First piece fits, and so the puzzle will be complete.‚Äù</em><br /></p>

<p>There are hundreds of thousands of words to learn don‚Äôt fret missing one or two or ten words.</p>

<p><b>Anki is taking too much time, I rather immerse</b><br />
As mentioned previously, if you have very limited amount of time daily, then always prioritise Immersion. That being said, if you‚Äôre spending 2+ hours on Anki, then maybe you have too many cards to review. You should <ins>reduce the amount</ins> of cards you need to review. Currently, I only review 15 NEW cards per day with a total of under 70 cards daily. Without distractions I can usually complete this in about 15-20minutes on average. You really shouldn‚Äôt take longer than 30minutes on Anki per day.</p>

<p><b>Do I need to learn how to write?</b><br />
In the modern world, not necessarily. If you enjoy it, or if your goal is to do caligraphy etc. sure go ahead. Otherwise, if your goal is to read and speak daily conversations, no its not needed. Time spent practicing writing can be better spent reading or listening more.</p>
