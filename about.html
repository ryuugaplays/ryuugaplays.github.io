<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I have loved Japanese culture ever since I can remember. When I was really young I had bootlegged tapes of 仮面ライダー（Kamen Rider）I would watch on repeat. When I was a teen, I rediscovered Japanese culture through anime and by extension, Japanese music and a whole world of yet to be discovered treasures. Shortly after I started learning Japanese from a 'traditional' Language school, and while the traditional learning method taught me a lot of the basics, it didn't go much deeper than that. How could it? 	
</p>


<p>I wore a proud badge thinking I was good at Japanese for many years, and then when I finally got a chance to go to Japan, reality came crashing down on me. I. Don't. Know. Japanese. I couldn't read fast enough, I couldn't speak a word, I could only barely pick up words from day-to-day conversations. Around this time, I discovered Immersion Language Learning, and Comprehensive Input. In 2020, I decided I would dedicate my free time in pursuit of reaching as close to native level as possible. Through Twitch and through this website, I hope to share (and receive) learning tips from everyone. The adventure starts here!
